Rapid clicker is a tiny application for left clicking at variable speeds. It utilizes [InputManager](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/117657/InputManager-library-Track-user-input-and-simulate), a library for mouse press generation at a raw input level, it's really fast.

### Installation
Extract the zip, place the rapidClicker folder anywhere you like. There's nothing to install, to uninstall simply delete the folder.

### Usage

You'll need .NET3.5 or higher. Also, to get rapidClicker to work with some applications you'll need to run it as administrator by right clicking on the executable and choosing run as admin.

Once running, specify a delay in milliseconds (1000ms = 1 second) and use left ctrl to toggle clicking. If you're playing the steam summer sale game, I recommend about 10-15ms.

Since mouse presses are carried out at a direct input level, you can pretend that you're physically clicking the mouse, windows applications will not notice a difference, best of all you do not have to have the application in focus.
